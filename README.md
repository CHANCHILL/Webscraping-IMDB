Web Scraping IMDb Top 250 Movies Using Python

Project Overview:

This project involves web scraping the IMDb website to extract data on the Top 250 highest-rated movies of all time. The scraping is done using Selenium for browser automation and dynamic content rendering, followed by BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing. The extracted data is then cleaned and structured, and finally exported into an Excel spreadsheet using the openpyxl library.

Tech Stack:

1. Selenium – To automate web browsing and retrieve the dynamically generated HTML content.
2. BeautifulSoup – To parse and extract relevant data such as rank, movie titles, release years and ratings
3. openpyxl – To write and load the scraped data into an Excel file.
4. Python – Core scripting


Data Extracted:

1. Rank
2. Movie Title
3. Year of Release
4. IMDb Rating

Outcome:
A clean, structured Excel file containing the Top 250 IMDb movies, useful for further data analysis or visualization demonstrating proficiency in web scraping, handling dynamic content, data cleaning, and basic data storage/export.
